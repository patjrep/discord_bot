# VOM_COM

Vom_Com was a discord bot I began making to show my younger sister the possibilities of coding, while using an interesting platform (discord) which is used by her and her friends.

##Functionality

There are a few basic items in there where if a user sends a message the bot will reply. It has become more complex to include the ability to grant users a random amount of money and a user inventory buy/sell system (in-prog)
